# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 5 - Work Day Planner

## Description

1. In this challenge, my main goal was to create a Work Day Planner that would span an entire workday (9am to 5pm) and as the day progresses, would change the color of the different sections to correspond with the given time. In addition, within each section the user would be able to input and save events within the webpage so that they will persist upon refresh.

2. In this project, I practiced using third party libraries, DOM traversal with third-party libraries,implementing datetime functionality within an application and allowing dynamic updates via setInterval() and setTimeout()!

3. I found that reusuing the same colors from a previous project to update the color scheme proved very useful! Chances to recycle concepts from previous projects seems integral in some instances to further build upon chances to learn.

4. Adding and removing classes to allow color change to occur seemed like a very fun concept, rather than directly changing the CSS directly for each section one by one.
